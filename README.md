[![build](https://github.com/CCBR/CRISPIN/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CCBR/CRISPIN/actions/workflows/build.yml)

## Set up

Cruise is installed on the [Biowulf HPC](#biowulf).
For installation in other execution environments,
refer to the [docs](https://ccbr.github.io/crispin).

### Biowulf

Cruise is available on [Biowulf](https://hpc.nih.gov/) in the `ccbrpipeliner` module.
You'll first need to start an interactive session and create a directory from where you'll run crispin.

```sh
# start an interactive node
sinteractive --mem=2g --cpus-per-task=2 --gres=lscratch:200
# make a working directory for your project and go to it
mkdir -p /data/$USER/crisprseq
cd /data/$USER/crisprseq
# load the ccbrpipeliener module
module load ccbrpipeliner
```

## Usage

Initialize and run crispin with test data:

```sh
# copy the crispin config files to your current directory
crispin init
# preview the crispin jobs that will run with the test dataset
crispin run --mode local -profile test -preview
# launch a crispin run on slurm with the test dataset
crispin run --mode slurm -profile test,biowulf
```

To run crispin on your own data, you'll need to create a sample sheet.
Take a look at the example:
[assets/samplesheet_test_biowulf.csv](assets/samplesheet_test_biowulf.csv).

You'll also need to select an appropriate library for your dataset.
CRISPIN is bundled with several libraries in [assets/lib](assets/lib),
or you can download your own.
Once you've created a samplesheet with paths to your fastq files,
run crispin with the `--input` option to specify the path to your sample sheet
and `--library` for the path to your library file:

```sh
crispin run --mode slurm -profile biowulf --input samplesheet.csv --library assets/lib/yusa_library.csv
```
